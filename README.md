## BotChat status

The `BotChat` base plugin supports localized YAML message pools and
configurable probabilities for greetings, match-end lines, and kill
reactions. It exposes the `botchat:api` capability so optional chat
enhancements can share speaker arbitration, identity validation, and the
delivery path without being built into BotChat itself.

`Banter` is an optional enhancement plugin. It owns SteamID-keyed grudges,
persona behavior, highlight/revenge/taunt chains, and separate `lang/*.yml`
pools. It can be installed or removed independently and remains idle when
the `botchat:api` provider is unavailable.

When upgrading from the combined plugin, move the properties inside the old
BotChat `Banter` object into `configs/plugins/Banter/Banter.json`, then remove
the old `Banter` and `Taunts` objects. Deploy one `BotChatApi.dll` under
`addons/counterstrikesharp/shared/BotChatApi/`; both plugins use that shared
contract assembly.

BotHider `identity_mode: bot` still has an unresolved delivery limitation:
messages are not reliably visible when sent through the fake-client identity.
This branch does not claim that mode is fixed; the remaining work belongs in
the BotHider/native fake-client send path. Use `identity_mode: player` when
BotChat output is required until that path is investigated further.
